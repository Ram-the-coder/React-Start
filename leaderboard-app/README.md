# Leaderboard-app using React.js
## Webstacks task 3
<b>Similarities:</b>
- On clicking the name of a person, their description will be displayed
- Navigation with the help of navbar
- Highlighting the top 3

<b>Dissimilarities:</b>
- Improved the UI because I didn't like the previous one which was basic because I had to concentrate on back-end.
- Created components for:
  - Navbar
  - Leaderboard page
  - Login page
  - Register page
  - Card - to display the top 3
  - List - to display the rest of the people
- The user information of people other than the top 3 will not be shown on clicking their name. Its a feature that can be included easily when using PHP by using loops
